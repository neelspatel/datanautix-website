Traditionally most companies take a subjective and qualitative approach to analyzing this data.  Datanautix has developed a platform that enables companies to turn that subjective/qualitative information into insight by structuring the data to make it more objective and quantifiable.  Using an n-gram token parser, the system extracts the most common phrases or snippets from the vebatims so that clients can get a quick snapshot into key drivers of customer sentiment.</p>

Datanautix developed a Risk Assessment Model that agents could use to place customers into risk buckets and structure the conversation appropriately.  The model was over 90% accurate at predicting the likelihood of collecting the outstanding balance in a timely manner.   </p>
